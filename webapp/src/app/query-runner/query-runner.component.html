        In this demo, three hospitals want to determine if a patient has
        diabetes or not. To avoid invasive procedures, theses only want to
        proceed with the full test if it is likely that the patient has it.
      </p>

      <p>
        To predict if someone is having diabetes, these hospitals use what is
        known as a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model"
          >generalized linear model</a
        >. It is a statistical method used to predict the likeliness of someone
        exhibiting a condition, based on a known set of representative values.
        It works in two phases, first the training, where the model ingests
        data, then you can predict with the trained model, to determine if some
        new patient is likely sick.
        <br />
        For example, imagine if having diabetes was only determined by the age
        of the patient, after 40, you are assured to have it. After training,
        your model will come to the same conclusion, and when asked to predict
        if a patient is diabetic, it will only look at their age, and answer
        accordingly.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to improve the quality of the model, these hospitals need to
        share the collected data, but doing so trivially does endanger the
        patient's privacy. If they decide to put all the data at the same place,
        there is a greater risk that such a treasure will be attacked. If they
        decide to keep the data locally and only share the model, it can still
        leak data by "reversing" part of it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here comes SPINDLE, which enables some statistics on distributed
        databases without sharing any data in clear. It does so by using a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice-based_cryptography"
          >new kind of cryptography</a
        >, allowing to apply common mathematical operations on encrypted data
        and only revealing the result.
      </p>

      <p>
        Around this text, you can see the three hospitals' data, which you can
        see the content of by clicking on it. Each data is stored in a separated
        instance of SPINDLE, none of it is shared as it but is first encrypted.
        By cooperating with each other, the hospitals can deliver the
        statistical results to you, without any privacy issues.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, you can move to the next part, where you will use the network to
        create a predicator.

        Here, you can train a statistical model which allows for predicting if a
        new patient is likely to have diabetes. Each hospital will first train a
        local model then merge it with the others, which will be used for the
        next local iteration, and so on.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each parameter below controls some aspects of the training. The higher
        the number of iteration, the preciser the model will be but the more
        time it'll take to finish training.

        Now, we are waiting for SPINDLE to build the model. Each hospital
        computes a local model based on its dataset. When enough local round are
        made, a network model is created by merging each local ones together.
        Then a new local round is started, merged with the rest of the network,
        and so on, each iteration yielding a better model.
